# Email Extractor

This is a [chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) that extracts email addresses out of a web page and into a comma delimited list in your clipboard. You can then paste it into a BCC field of an email.

There are specific conditions for the formatting of the data on the page that must be met in order to extract them:

* The data must reside in a table.
* Each Table row must contain an email address in one of it's cells.
* Each Table row must contain a cell with a checkbox that is checked.
